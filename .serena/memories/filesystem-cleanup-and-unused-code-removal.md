# Filesystem Cleanup and Unused Code Removal

Performed comprehensive cleanup of unused utilities in the SWB codebase.

## Removed Files

- **`src/utils/filesystem.ts`** - Contained unused `glob` function for Windows file pattern matching
  - Function was well-implemented but never actually used in the codebase
  - Only referenced in example comments and documentation

## Updated Files

- **`src/utils/index.ts`** - Removed export of `glob` function
- **`src/utils/shell.ts`** - Updated JSDoc comments to remove filesystem.ts reference
- **README.md** - Already clean, no updates needed

## Verification Process

1. **Usage Analysis**: Searched entire codebase for `glob` function calls - found none except in examples
2. **Import Analysis**: Verified filesystem.ts was only imported in utils/index.ts for re-export
3. **Build Test**: Confirmed project builds successfully after removal
4. **Reference Check**: Ensured no remaining references to filesystem.ts in source code

## Original filesystem.ts Implementation

The removed file contained:

- `glob(pattern, options)` function using Windows `dir` command
- Support for wildcards (\* and ?) and recursive patterns (\*\*)
- Proper error handling and path normalization
- TypeScript types and comprehensive JSDoc documentation

## Benefits of Removal

- **Cleaner codebase**: Eliminated dead code that served no purpose
- **Reduced bundle size**: Less code to compile and bundle
- **Maintenance**: Fewer files to maintain and update
- **Clarity**: Clearer module structure without unused exports

## Key Insight

This cleanup demonstrates the importance of regular code audits to identify and remove unused functionality, even when it's well-implemented. The glob functionality was comprehensive but ultimately unnecessary for the project's current requirements.
